```
nltk==3.9.1
pandas==2.2.3
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-finder.git
   cd word-finder
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download NLTK word corpus:
   ```python

## Usage
Run the script to start an interactive search session:
```sh
python main.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to search for words based on your criteria.

## Example Search
- Find words that must contain "A" and "S", must not contain "R" and "T", and start with "P":
  ```
  Enter letters that must be contained (comma-separated, e.g., 'S,A'): A,S
  Enter letters that must not be contained (comma-separated, e.g., 'R,T'): R,T
  Enter the prefix that the words must start with (leave blank if none): P
